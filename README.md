# Software engineering stack
I'm a fullstack who discovered that, maybe, mobile programming isn't for me.

## My current favorite stack
- Backend using Elixir and Phoenix
- Frontend using React
- GraphQL (although REST is really nice too!)

## What I'm currently working with
- React with TypeScript
- Microfrontends (the hype is real)

## What I'm studying at the moment
- Deeper SQL stuff
- 

## Other stuff I've worked with
- Python, Golang, C# and NodeJS in the backend
- Vue, Nuxt, Preact, MobX, Redux and styled-components in the frontend
- React Native for mobile development

## Other (ir)relevant information
- PostgreSQL is my favorite SQL database
- I think that, most times, the "best tool for the job" does not exist. Sometimes you may go with your preference and there is nothing wrong about it (but, of course, it depends haha)
- Functional programming is beautiful and I hope it dominates the world someday
- Elixir has the best programming language ergonomics I've ever seen
- I love to learn and to teach
- Passionate about mentoring and giving carreer advices
